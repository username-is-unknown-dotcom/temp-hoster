            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This report provides an overview of two open-source projects focused on traffic object detection,
                specifically lane line detection and traffic sign detection. The methods employed in these projects are
                evaluated for their applicability to our dataset, considering their performance, limitations, and
                potential use in compliance and legality measures for traffic systems.</p>

            <h3>Open Source 1: Lane Line Detection</h3>

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <p>The lane line detection system uses Canny edge detection combined with the Hough Line Transform. Canny
                edge detection helps in identifying the edges in the image, and the Hough Line Transform is used to
                detect straight lines, which are crucial for identifying lane boundaries on the road.</p>

            <h4>Testing and Results</h4>

            </video>

            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>Although effective in detecting lane lines, the method encounters difficulties in more complex scenarios,
                such as poor weather conditions and busy roads. The following video illustrates some of these
                limitations:</p>

                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>

            <p>Despite these limitations, this open-source project remains promising for our dataset, as the scenarios
                in our dataset are relatively less complex and do not exhibit the extreme conditions seen in the testing
                video.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h3>Open Source 2: Traffic Sign Detection</h3>

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <p>The traffic sign detection system utilizes the YOLOv5s object detection algorithm, a state-of-the-art
                deep learning model for real-time object detection. YOLOv5s is known for its balance between speed and
                accuracy, making it suitable for detecting a variety of traffic signs in real-time.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Both open-source projects—Lane Line Detection and Traffic Sign Detection—offer promising methods for
                traffic object detection. While the lane line detection project has limitations under complex
                conditions, it remains useful for our dataset. The traffic sign detection system, based on YOLOv5s, is
                highly effective and suitable for real-time applications. Both solutions can contribute to enhancing
                compliance and legality measures in traffic systems.</p>
